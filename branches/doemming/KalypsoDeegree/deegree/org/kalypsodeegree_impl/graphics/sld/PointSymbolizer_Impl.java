     * A Graphic is a "graphic symbol" with an inherent shape, color, and size.
     * Graphics can either be referenced from an external URL in a common format
     * (such as GIF or SVG) or may be derived from a Mark. Multiple external URLs
     * may be referenced with the semantic that they all provide the same graphic
     * in different formats. The "hot spot" to use for rendering at a point or
     * the start and finish handle points to use for rendering a graphic along a
     * line must either be inherent in the external format or are system-
     * dependent. The default size of an image format (such as GIF) is the
     * inherent size of the image. The default size of a format without an
     * inherent size is 16 pixels in height and the corresponding aspect in width.
     * If a size is specified, the height of the graphic will be scaled to that
     * size and the corresponding aspect will be used for the width. The default
     * if neither an ExternalURL nor a Mark is specified is to use the default
     * Mark with a size of 6 pixels. The size is in pixels and the rotation is in
     * degrees clockwise, with 0 (default) meaning no rotation. In the case that
     * a Graphic is derived from a font-glyph Mark, the Size specified here will
     * be used for the final rendering. Allowed CssParameters are "opacity",
     * "size", and "rotation".
