/**
 * Base interface for all coordinate systems.
 * A coordinate system is a mathematical space, where the elements of
 * the space are called positions.  Each position is described by a list
 * of numbers.  The length of the list corresponds to the dimension of
 * the coordinate system.  So in a 2D coordinate system each position is
 * described by a list containing 2 numbers.
 * <br><br>
 * However, in a coordinate system, not all lists of numbers correspond
 * to a position - some lists may be outside the domain of the coordinate
 * system.  For example, in a 2D Lat/Lon coordinate system, the list (91,91)
 * does not correspond to a position.
 * <br><br>
 * Some coordinate systems also have a mapping from the mathematical space
 * into locations in the real world.  So in a Lat/Lon coordinate system, the
 * mathematical position (lat, long) corresponds to a location on the surface
 * of the Earth.  This mapping from the mathematical space into real-world
 * locations is called a Datum.
