<h1>License Terms</h1>

<p>
`We' refers to the copyright holders. `You' refers to the licensee.
`Renew' refers to the complete set of sources, executables,
and sample nets that make up the Reference Net Workshop.
</p>

<p>
Renew is available free of charge, but not without restrictions.
</p>

<p>
The license section got a bit long. We apologize, but we cannot hope
to do better, because we included
<a href="http://www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/TGI/renew/contributors.html">many external parts</a> with many
different licenses.
</p>

<h2>Contributed Parts</h2>

<h4>The Collections Package</h4>

<p>
The <tt>collections</tt> package is used as our set/queue/list
implementation. The relevant license information
states:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Originally written by Doug Lea and released into the public domain. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
You can use it as you want. Please note that Doug Lea now suggests to
use the container libraries that come with Java&nbsp;1.2 instead of his
own libraries.
We are currently working on the migration, so far the simulator
plug-in has been adopted to the Java container classes.
</p>


<h4>The JHotDraw Package</h4>

<p>
The <tt>JHotDraw</tt> graphical editor written by Erich Gamma
is copyrighted. The relevant license information states:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
JHotDraw is copyright 1996, 1997 by IFA Informatik and Erich Gamma.
</p>

<p>
It is hereby granted that this software can be used, copied, modified,
and distributed without fee provided that this copyright notice
appears in all copies.
</p>
</blockquote>


<h4>Code Generated from JavaCC</h4>

<p>
Some of the code of Renew was generated by the parser
generator JavaCC. The relevant license information
states:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
3. DEVELOPED PRODUCTS
</p>

<p>
You may use the Software to generate software program(s) ("Developed
Programs").  Sun claims no rights in or to the Developed Programs.
</p>

<p>
4. YOUR INDEMNIFICATION OF SAMPLE GRAMMARS
DERIVATIVES AND DEVELOPED PRODUCTS
</p>

<p>
You agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Sun from and against
any claims or suits, including attorneys' fees, which arise or result
from any use or distribution of Sample Grammar Derivatives and/or
Developed Programs.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Hence we would like to explicitly point out that Sun is not responsible
for any problems that might result from the use of the output of JavaCC.
</p>


<h4>Bill's Java Grammar</h4>

<p>
A Java grammar <tt>billsJava1.0.2.jj</tt>
was distributed together with JavaCC 0.7 as a sample grammar.
Bill McKeeman (<tt>mckeeman@mathworks.com</tt>)
contributed this grammar to JavaCC.
The relevant license information from Sun states:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
2. SAMPLE GRAMMARS
</p>

<p>
You may modify the sample grammars included in the Software to develop
derivatives thereof ("Sample Grammar Derivatives"), and sublicense the
Sample Grammar Derivatives directly or indirectly to your customers.
</p>

<p>
4. YOUR INDEMNIFICATION OF SAMPLE GRAMMARS
DERIVATIVES AND DEVELOPED PRODUCTS
</p>

<p>
You agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Sun from and against
any claims or suits, including attorneys' fees, which arise or result
from any use or distribution of Sample Grammar Derivatives and/or
Developed Programs.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The original parts of <tt>billsJava1.0.2.jj</tt> which
are now contained in a modified form
in the files <tt>JavaNetParser.jj</tt>,
<tt>FSNetParser.jj</tt>, <tt>FSParser.jj</tt>, and 
<tt>StubParser.jj</tt> are Copyright (C) 1996, 1997 
Sun Microsystems Inc. A sublicense for these grammars is hereby
granted. If you have any further questions, please consult the
file <tt>COPYRIGHT</tt> as distributed with JavaCC.
</p>


<h4>Graph Layout Algorithm</h4>

<p>
The graph layout algorithm used in the class 
<tt>de.renew.util.GraphLayout</tt> was originally provided by Sun
as part of the Java Development Kit.
The relevant license information from Sun states:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Sun grants you ("Licensee") a non-exclusive, royalty free, license to use,
modify and redistribute this software in source and binary code form,
provided that i) this copyright notice and license appear on all copies of
the software; and ii) Licensee does not utilize the software in a manner
which is disparaging to Sun.
</p>

<p>
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</p>

<p>
This software is not designed or intended for use in on-line control of
aircraft, air traffic, aircraft navigation or aircraft communications; or in
the design, construction, operation or maintenance of any nuclear
facility. Licensee represents and warrants that it will not use or
redistribute the Software for such purposes.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We would like to explicitly point out that Sun is not responsible
for any problems that might result from the use of the graph layout 
algorithm. See the source files for Sun's original disclaimer.
</p>

<h2>Original Parts</h2>

<p>
This copyright section deals with those part of
Renew that are not based on other works, i.e. the example nets
and the packages
<tt>fs</tt> and <tt>de.renew</tt> without the JavaCC grammars.
</p>

<h4>Example Nets</h4>

<p>
The example nets are in the public domain. You may modify
them as you like. You may use them as the basis for
your own nets without restrictions.
</p>


<h4>Java Source Code and Executables</h4>

<p>
Sources and executables are copyright 1998--2004 by Olaf Kummer, 
Frank Wienberg, Michael Duvigenau, and others.
You can distribute these files under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html" target="_top">GNU 
Lesser General Public License</a>. 
</p>

<p>
You will receive a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License
along with Renew in the file <tt>doc/COPYING</tt>.
</p>


<h4>Created Parts</h4>

<p>
You are permitted to use works that you create with Renew
(i.e., Java stubs, net drawings, PostScript output,
simulation states, and other exported data) without restrictions.
</p>


<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>
We distribute Renew in the hope that it will be useful,
but <em>without any warranty</em>; without even the implied warranty of
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.
</p>

<p>
We are <em>not liable</em> for any direct, 
indirect, incidental or consequential damage including, 
but not limited to, loss of data, loss of profits, or
system failure, which arises out of use or inability to
use Renew or works created with Renew.
This clause does not apply to gross negligence or premeditation.
</p>

<p>
Some parts of Renew may use <em>patented techniques</em> that may not 
be freely usable in some countries. In that case, it is the 
responsibility of the user of Renew to obtain a license on the 
aforementioned techniques before using Renew.
</p>

<p>
Some parts of Renew may include additional disclaimers
in their license terms. In such cases, both disclaimers
hold simultaneously. If one clause of any disclaimer
is found invalid under applicable law, this does not affect
the validity of the remaining clauses or of other disclaimers.
</p>
