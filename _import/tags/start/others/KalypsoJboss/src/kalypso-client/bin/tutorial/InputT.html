In table RainStation and ClimateStation the parameters to connect with DataCenter are to be set. <br>
The RRM needs for calculation precipitation rate [mm] per time interval.<br>
The interval of precipitation rate is not restricted for input in RRM. The RRM calculates by interpolation rate per simulation time step. For output precipitation intensity [mm/h] is generated.
Temperature RRM models with daily average values. Measured temperature must aggregated in DataCenter, otherwise RRM reads for the day last measured value.
Like mentioned in DataCenter there are different channels for measured parameters possible. Each channel can also offer different types of tables:
<ul>
<li> Measured<br>
<li> Work (if values are not or wrong measured at station user can correct values)<br>
<li> Forecast<br>
<li> Aggregated<br>
</ul>
To build up connection to DataCenter user can choose timeseries Browser from menu bar. The defined structure in DataCenter for stations (reflecting river basins) can be visualized.<br>
Then the user can directly in Kalypso Interface get a station object and by two buttons decide which table of station in DataCenter should be used for measured data and forecast. <br>
To create new row in table for station user gets commands in context menu. <br>
For gauging stations an import of measured discharge can be done in same way.
