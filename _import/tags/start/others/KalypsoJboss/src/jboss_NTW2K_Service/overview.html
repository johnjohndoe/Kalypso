      <p class="mainBold">Current Version: 1.2.0<br>
        Release Date: April 12, 2001</p>
      <p class="mainNormal">Java provides developers with a platform independent 
        programming API. This allows programs to be written and compiled for distinct 
        operating systems and architectures, such as Windows, Solaris, and Linux.</p>
      <p class="mainNormal">Windows NT/2000 includes a set of tools and APIs that 
        allow the creation and management of programs that run as background tasks, 
        or services. Services typically run without any user interaction. This 
        is especially useful when running programs, such as web servers, that 
        should start automatically when the operating systems starts. Also, a 
        service can be manually stopped, started, or paused using the service 
        control manager that is includes with the operating system.</p>
      <p class="mainNormal">JavaService is a Win32 executable that allows any 
        Java class to be run as an NT service. It uses JNI's invocation API to 
        create a Java Virtual Machine using any JNI compliant Java implementation. 
        JavaService can call the typical entry method</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="mainCode">static void main(String[])</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="mainNormal">in order to start the service, or any other method 
        you choose. In order to stop the service it can call another method or 
        simply terminate the JVM.</p>
      <p class="mainNormal">JavaService is free software. It is distributed using 
        a BSD style license. This means that you can do whatever you want with 
        it, provided you follow a <a href="license.html">few simple rules</a> 
        about distribution.</p>

      <blockquote> 
        <p class="mainBold">Version: 1.2.0<br>
          Release Date: April 12, 2001</p>
        <ul class="mainNormal">
          <li><b>Added the ability to have registry values greater than 256 characters</b>. 
            Registry access is now fully dynamic and values can have any length. 
            A lot of people were having problems with the 256 character limit. 
            I'm sorry it took so long to fix that, but I've been busy.</li>
          <li>Fixed several printf statements that were missing parameters. Thanks 
            to Anthony Tagunov for catching this.</li>
          <li>Fixed a problem that prevented registry errors from being displayed 
            properly. Thanks to Lars Johanson for sending in a fix for this.</li>
          <li>Fixed a missing parameter in the Tomcat 3.2 install batch file. 
            This is untested as I don't use Tomcat 3.2, so if someone would let 
            me know if it works or not, I would appreciate it. Thanks to Joe Siebenmann 
            for pointing out that there was a problem with the old batch file.</li>
          <li>Added a new parameter &quot;-current&quot; to allow the current 
            working directory to be specified. There were some people having problems 
            with code that used relative paths, so this should help them out.</li>
          <li>Added a new parameter &quot;-path&quot; to allow for extra path 
            information to be added for finding dependent DLLs. Thanks to Lars 
            Johanson for this submission.<br>
          </li>

        <p class="mainBold">Version: 1.1.1<br>
          Release Date: December 21, 2000 </p>
        <ul class="mainNormal">
          <li>Added a new batch file to install Tomcat 3.2 that was contributed 
            by James Bigler.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mainBold">Version: 1.1.0<br>
          Release Date: October 11, 2000 </p>
        <ul class="mainNormal">
          <li>Added an exit handler to the JVM so that a message is logged and 
            the service is stopped gracefully if the System.exit method is called. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mainBold">Version: 1.0.0<br>
          Release Date: August 27, 2000 </p>
        <ul class="mainNormal">
          <li>Modified to work around a bug in the Sun J2SE 1.3 that caused the 
            JVM to exit and the service to stop whenever a user logged off of 
            the system.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mainBold">Version: 0.9.0<br>

        </blockquote>
      <p class="mainBold"><a name="To_Do"></a>To Do</p>
      <p class="mainNormal">When stopping the service, the time to wait for both 
        the start and stop methods to return before the JVM is terminated is hard 
        coded to 30 seconds. Make this adjustable.</p>
      <p class="mainBold">Support</p>
