User defines project for structuring all dependant datasets: Model, Control and SimCase.<br>
Modelversion stores parameters for objects of RRM.
Important is the validation of hydrological and meteorological stations for each catchment.<br>
For continuous simulations a consistent data transfer is necessary. Therefore automatic stations should be part of input data.
The modelversions for the both flood events can be used as basis for further simulations because user has no possibility to change topological model ionput (landuse, soiltype, catchments, drainage net)
