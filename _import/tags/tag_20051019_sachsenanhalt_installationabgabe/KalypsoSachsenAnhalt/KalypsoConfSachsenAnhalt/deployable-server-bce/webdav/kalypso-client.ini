# Configuration file for kalypso-clients.
#
# This configuration has two main parts:
# 1- it defines which services are available at which URLs.
#    For each service type, more than one service can be 
#    specified. In that case, separate the location with
#    commas.
# 2- it contains URLs to various files (directories of files,
#    files, conf-files, etc.). The convention says that
#    each property which ends in 'URL' denotes a real
#    URL. It can either be relative (in that case to this
#    conf-file) or absolute.
