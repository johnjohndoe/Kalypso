 Frequently-Asked-Questions about KALYPSO




 1 What is needed to run KALYPSO

  1. java  (  java.sun.com )
  2. jboss ( www.jboss.org )





 2 How to install JBOSS


  The installation of JBOSS is very simple:
  you will find JBOSS on http://www.jboss.org
  1. download newest version on your system. (zip-archive)
  2. unpack archive into your jboss-installation directory
  3. set environment-variables to the installation-directory of JAVA and JBOSS
  example:
  JBOSS_HOME=c:\files\jboss\jboss3.0.3\
  JAVA_HOME=C:\j2sdk\bin\
  4. now jboss is installed on your system

  to start JBOSS-server:
   execute JBOSS_HOME\bin\run.bat    (run.sh for unix)
  to shutdown JBOSS-server:
   execute JBOSS_HOME\bin\shutdown.bat  (shutdown.sh for unix)

  to start/shutdown JBOSS automaticly via NT/W2K service
   use a service-wrapper (see JBOSS-3.0-Quick-Start-Guide,
   available also on www.jboss.org)




 3 How to install KALYPSO

  to deploy KALYPSO in JBOSS:

   copy javaGis1.jar to JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/
   copy javaGis2.jar to JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/
   copy javaGis3.jar to JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/

   copy KALYPSO-install-dir to your local filesystem (e.g. c:\flomatis\kalypso )

   edit kalypsoMain.conf for your local settings.

  --8<--example of kalypsoMain--8<---

    # url to access the time series database
    bce_url=jdbc\:edbc\://172.22.222.227\:LP7/BCE_PC067\:\:dbflomatis2/INGRES

    # template files user by the simulation process
    template_simulation=c:\flomatis\Kalypso\kalypso_template

  --8<-----------------------8<---







  4. no connection to time series database:

   - is the time series server reachable via lan ?
    -> try ping to find out.

   - wrong settings in configfile kalypsoMain.conf
    -> check settings of: bce_url, bce_user and bce_pass

   - physical connection has been interrupted,
    -> restart kalypsoRRM

   - is time series database running ?
    -> restart database




  5. no connection to modell-database

   - check, if jboss is running ?
    start jboss via c:\program files\jboss\jboss3.0.3\bin\run.bat

   - check if network is working (jboss uses also networking for intern processes)





  6. programm hangs - is this a crash ?

   - some kalypso processes need some time to proceed. In this time
     the user interface is not updated.
     these processes are espacially:
      * import/export of (xml)-modell-data.
      * loading the netview
      * running the simulation
    -> In this case, please be patient and wait,

   - did you click into the running DOS-BOX ? maybe by mistake ?
    if there is a selection in a DOS-BOX, Windows halts the dependent applications
    -> click again in the DOS-BOX to remove the selection or press <Enter> in the DOS-BOX

   - did you run extern programms from kalypso ?
    -> close these programms (e.g. graphic-tool)





  7. My changes are not stored in the database.

    - It is important, that you commit every change in a table by the <Return>-key, cause
    the application needs to know when to store the data in the database.

    - with timestamps (e.g. start of simulation) you have to use the correct pattern.
     the tooltip will show you, what pattern exactly is needed.

    - vectorSets are stored when you close the vectorSet-window or choose "save" from the vectorSet`s
      menue.




  8. the simulation is not successfull

    - check logView and output in the DOS-BOX

    - validate your parameters, missing parameters will make problems

    - check if you are in the correct directory, when using the graphic-tool
