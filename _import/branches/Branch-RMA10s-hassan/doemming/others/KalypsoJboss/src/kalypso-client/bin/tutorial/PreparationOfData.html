User defines project for structuring all dependant datasets: <b>Model, Control and SimCase.</b><br>
Modelversion stores parameters for objects of RRM. Versions for the flood events are available as xml-file which can be imported in a new created version.
Important is the validation of hydrological and meteorological stations for each catchment.For continuous simulations a consistent data transfer is necessary. Therefore automatic stations should be part of input data.
The ModelData versions for the both flood events can be used as basis for further simulations because user has no possibility to change topological, spacial model data.<br>
(landuse, soiltype, catchments, drainage net)
<br>
<body>
<ul>
<li> Build up hydrological and meteorological measuring network and define hydrological stations for catchments, <br>
use ArcView project to select catchments which can be reflected by station: <br>
Recheck before simulation if correct time-series in DataCeter are existing for simulation interval.<br>
For temperature average daily values and for precipitation rates per time interval are needed.<br>
User must prepare time-series in DataCentre and built up connection to station in DataCenter <br>
(each catchment must get one Climate and one RainStation).
<li> DataCenter check up continuously data import of automatic stations<br>
<li> Data from other stations in region import in tables of DataCentre <br>
<li> Define subsystems by root node for different regions <br>
<li> Choose ModelData version for simulation<br>
Validated modelversion with defined initial conditions. If corresponding climate situation is present user can choose from this state a modelversion.<br>
<li> Recheck of initial conditions when copied version, or define initial condition with Excel table "initial soilmoisture", CD Kalypso.
Validate correction factors for time-series to consider special hydrological conditions in region <br>
<li> Set start and end date of simulation. Time step [h] is dependant on quality of input data and interval of simulation (only 1086 timesteps can be calculated by program).
<li> If no temperature is set within interval for standard 5 °C is set.<br>
<li> Run simulation <br>
<li> Open graphic tool for visualization <br>
<li> Start calibration <br>
<li> To add measured discharge in same choose in output directory of simulation files for gauging station. Before in DataCentre an aggregation form watertable to discharge at gauges is to practice. <br>
The file with measuring discharge can be load form results_kalypso/klima.dat.<br>
<li> Open GraphicTool and validate simulation
</ul>
