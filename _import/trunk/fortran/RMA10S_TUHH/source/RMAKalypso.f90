!......... Main program unit for the 1D/2D coupled hydrodynamics model RMA·Kalypso
!
!          The splitting of RMA·Kalypso from its origin RMA-10S 8.0 took place in the
!          end of 2008. The capabilities of the software were adapted for the usage
!          of 1D/2D modelling in the modelling environment Kalypso, available under
!          sourceforge.com
!
!          REVISION 1.1.0
!          October 28th, 2008
!
!          initial revision with the following capabilites
!           - 2D modelling (more details necessary!)
!           - 1D modelling with descriptive polynomials for natural open channels and pipes (pressure flow)
!           - 1D/2D modelling along line transitions
!           - ... to be continued

!          REVISION 1.1.0
!          January 09th, 2009
!
!          initial revision with the following capabilites
!           - shore line friction support for Darcy-Weisbach in coef25 and coef25nt; not yet for coef2d*
!           - Reactivation of the efpor scaling; problems occur, if elements are too steep perpendicular to the flow direction
!           - bugfixes and code modernizations
!           - Changes for input lines C5 and C6 regarding output frequencies
