Initial conditions define hydrological conditions at the starting date of simulation. When running a longterm simulation Kalypso RRM can generate initial conditions for starting date of following shortterm simulation.<br>
For this project initial conditions need to be estimated for the hydrological condition dependent on exiting climate (precipitation and temperature) and hydrological data.
Main initial conditions for upper river basin Tisza are: <br>
<ul>
<li> Soil moisture<br>
<li> Snow height<br>
</ul>
The other explained parameters can be fixed in model because of less influence.<br>
The initial conditions are defined for a catchment. <br>
User can define special state for initial conditions to save their validated modelversions for next simulations of flood events with same former conditions.
<br><br><b> Soil Moisture</b><br>
Usable soil moisture = (maximum pore volume - point of withered) * soil thickness
To estimate the percentage of maximum soil moisture for initial soil moisture both soil characteristics and climate need to be known: <br>
Both factors influence the water absorption capacity of soil.
Table 1 fits to calculate maximal possible soil moisture capacity which increases by falling rain cannot stored temporal in soillayer.<br>
Therefore interflow and overland discharge rise at present.
Climate situation defines the percentage of soil moisture at starting date of simu-lation. Extremely heavy rain follows up excessive soil moisture up to 100

Percentage of soil moisture depends on climate conditions equal for all soil layers in elevation zone:<br>
<u>Wet climate conditions</u> <br>
Alpine and foothills: 	0.5 to 0.8<br>
Lowland: 0.7 to 0.9<br>
<u>Winter with frozen soil</u><br>
Kalypso RRM is not able to consider process of frozen soil regime. Special hydrological knowledge of climate situation is necessary.<br>
Either frozen soil can be simulated by low infiltration rate or by changes of soil moisture which considers the frozen water in soillayer.
<br><br>
<b>Snow height and water content</b> <br>
Snow height [mm]<br>
Water content standard: 10 %<br><br>

<b>Interception storage </b><br>
Dry: 0 mm<br>
Wet: 1 mm<br>
<br>
<b>Groundwater height </b><br>
Standard: middle of upper and lower groundwater stage<br>
Not important for shortterm simulation because of slow groundwater discharge in contrast to surface runoff. Therefore no estimation is necessary and parameters can be fixed.
