Same workflow like simulation flood event. To forecast flood former steps before simulation are important:<br>
<ul>
<li> Set forecast time-series if data can be required by weather report or other institutions in table forecast in <b>DataCenter</b> for contributing stations.<br>
If stations in subsystem of simulation receive no forecast precipitation or temperature only measured date will be used for imput.
<li> Define connection on <b>DataCenter</b> forcast in tables <b>RainStation</b> and <b>ClimateStation</b>
<li>Forecast values are mapped with measured time-series till end date of measured interval at station.
</ul>
