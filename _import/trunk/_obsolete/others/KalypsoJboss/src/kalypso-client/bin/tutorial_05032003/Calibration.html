<P>For calibration of simulated flood events, measured discharged hydrographs are required.<br>
To get discharge time-series user can define DataCenter connection in same way like for hydrological stations. <br>
If parameters are set measured discharge is available for GRAFICTOOL in files in the directory klima.dat in <b>kalypso_results</b>.
Data sets of different quality for the flood events 1998 and 2001 are used for model setup. The RRM could only be calibrated and validated for this two events.
<u>A continuous calibration for the next flood events is necessary.</u>
</P>
The object of calibration has to minimise the difference between observed and simulated flows. <br>
The calibration of the model will be achieved if there is a good match between the simulated and measured values of the following hydrograph characteristics:
<ul>
<li> Total runoff volume
<li> Peak flow
</ul>
In practice, the user can choose any of the two functions, depending on the special model being considered on purpose.<br>
<u>Peak flow agreement is important during storm water, flooding.</u> <br>
For UTRB no longterm simulation can be practised which is used for defining initial conditions and calibrating to achieve an agreement of total runoff volume.<br>
Flood forecasting is mainly interested in the significant peak flow and the temporal way of flow.
<br><br>
<h3><b>Calibration Workflow </b></h3>

Copy version of ModelData to new state in ModelData theme.<br>
Filter catchments within same elevation zone if numerous catchments are part of calibration and change only one of main calibration parameters at time to see the system reaction. <br>
To save the changes in Modeldata, version must be copied. Main calibration parameters and their usage for calibration are listed below. <br>
For validation it is useful to handle with subsystems of whole drainage net. The calibrated systems can then step by step be coupled to whole river network of UTRB.
<br><br>
<h3><b>Main calibration Parameters</b></h3>
<b>Retention constants</b><br>
Used to implement storage effects in catchment. Rising retention constants make discharge components slower and flatter flood wave.

Main Retention constants [h] (linear memory element):
<ul>
<li>Surface flow (80 to 90 % of total discharge)
<li> Interflow
Surface flow rises peak of flood and interflow varies kind of post-carriage of flood wave because of longer flow time in soil.
</ul>
<u>Surface flow</u><br>
Equal retention constants for natural and sealed areas are:
Alpine and foothill: less than 10 h
Lowland : app. twice slower than retention constants of alpine and foothill region<br><br>

<u>Interflow</u><br>
Triple slower than surface flow for mountain and lowland region.<br>
<u>Baseflow, Shallow and deep aquifer</u><br>
These discharge components are not needed for calibration because of long flow times in contrast to the other discharge components (Factor 100, 10.000, 100.000).<br>
Only in lowlands groundwater is estimated and modelled by RRM but without groundwater network only within storages in each catchments.
<br><br>
<b>Correction Factors</b><br>
Climate time-series temperature and rain
Correction factors can reflect spatial diversity in catchment: mountain or lowland. Rain is falling with higher intensity in mountain region.
Factors for precipitation from 1.2 to 3 (multiply) are possible, expert knowledge of existing/ forecasted climate situation.
To create special temperature curves use factor for temperature (factor is added on measured values).
<u>Soil layer</u><br>
Main infiltration and percolation rate:<br>
Proportional factors for infiltration and percolation, depending on characteristic soil properties [1/h]. Used to change volume of surface flow cause of corresponding higher or reduced infiltration/ percolation capacity.
Alpine and foothills: <ul><li>Infiltration 	3 mm/h
                        <li>Percolation	2 mm/h
Lowland:		<li>Infiltration 7 mm/h
                       <li> Percolation	6 mm/h </ul>

<u>Other correction factors</u><br>
Expert knowledge of vegetation and soil types. Not needed for calibration.<br><br>
<b>Kalinin-Miljukov-Parameters</b><br><br>
<u>Distribution factor C</u><br>
<br>
<img src=Screenshot026.gif align="center" >
<br><br>
It is used to define flooding:<br>
Alpine and foothill: app.0.5<br>
        Half of discharge in channel and the other part over flood plain<br>
Lowlands: less than 0.5<br>
        Extreme flooding cause of wide plains (up to 90 % discharge over flood plains)<br>
<br><br>
<u>Flow time, k and Number of memory elements, n</u><br>
K and n increases, flood wave gets broad and shallow.
<br><br>
n * k = flow time in strand element, defined by n memory elements, stady discharge with k as flow time of each memory element.
Flood routing parameters should be calibrated again for next flood events. If possible a separate KALININ-MILJUKOV-METHODE should check quality of parameters.
