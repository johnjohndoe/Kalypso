   *          <nl>
   *          <li>using the URL to link to an observation. In that case

   *          <li>using the full xml (in the case of the virtual repository)
   *          where the observation is coded as a filter (link to a real
   *          observation). In that case you won't set <code>obs</code> here
   *          since it is fetched per se.
   *          </nl>
   * 
   * @return filter
