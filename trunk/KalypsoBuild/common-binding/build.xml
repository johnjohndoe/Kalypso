Common build file for all binding projects.

The following targets are defined here:
- clean: cleans all generated stuff
- init
- compile: compiles the sources
- generate: runs xjc against the schemas to generate the source files
- deploy: builds a jar

It is designed to be imported using the following syntax:

 <import file="${workspace}/KalypsoBuild/common-binding/build.xml" />

  <!-- define following properties in importing script
	
	<property name="project" value="full path of the project..." />
	<property name="project-name" value="will be used for naming the jar containing the bindings..." />

	** files are imported 
	
	<patternset id="binding.schemata">

<!-- copy of the XJC-doc concerning "Up-to-date Check"

By default, the XJC binding compiler always compiles the inputs. However, with 
a little additional setting, it can compare timestamps of the input files and 
output files and skip compilation if the files are up-to-date.

Ideally, the program should be able to find out all the inputs and outputs and 
compare their timestamps, but this is difficult and time-consuming. So you have 
to tell the task input files and output files manually by using nested <depends>
and <produces> elements. Basically, the XJC binding compiler compares the 
timestamps specified by the <depends> elements against those of the <produces>
set. If any one of the "depends" file has a more recent timestamp than some 
of the files in the "produces" set, it will compile the inputs. Otherwise 
it will skip the compilation.

This will allow you to say, for example "if any of the .xsd files in this 
directory are newer than the .java files in that directory, recompile the schema".

Files specified as the schema files and binding files are automatically added 
to the "depends" set as well, but if those schemas are including/importing 
other schemas, you have to use a nested <depends> elements. No files are added
 to the <produces> set, so you have to add all of them manually.

A change in a schema or an external binding file often results in a Java file 
that stops being generated. To avoid such an "orphan" file, it is often desirable
to isolate all the generated code into a particular package and delete it before
compiling a schema. This can be done by using the removeOldOutput attribute. This
option allows you to remove all the files that match the "produces" filesets 
before a compilation. Be careful when you use this option so that you don't 
delete important files.
