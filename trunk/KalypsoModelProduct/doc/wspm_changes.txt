- Bugfix [#85] Dangling references in reaches: The reach view does not crash any more if the segments contain empty references to profiles.
- Fixed comment bug (name, comment disapeared after change to profile in profileditor, strange commment after import from wspwin)
- Sorting is now possible for all lists of features (instead of only profiles); TODO: reverse sort; sort by name; ...
- [#83] filenames for prf.-export: Most of the strange characters are now replaced by '_', so importing should work better.
- non-uniform bankfull calculation: Results are now retrieved as functions (singular points) over h and may be displayed as diagramms. Furthermore, polynomials (as input for the instationary calculation) are calulated automatically from the points and displayed as well.
- Feature request [#92]: Rougness-Intersection now supports multi-surface polygones.
