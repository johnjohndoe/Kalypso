		Description: currently only support for generating the service-proxies
		is provided.
	
		* proxy-services
		
		When the service interface of a service changes, there is
		a builder (configured for this Project) that 
		calls the corresponding target from this build file in order
		to generate the proxy-jar needed to comminucate with the
		web service (jaxrpc).

		Some of the service-proxies depend on core-projects such as
		KalypsoCore, etc. In order to take care of these
		dependencies there's the target 'build-core' which builds
		all of them.
