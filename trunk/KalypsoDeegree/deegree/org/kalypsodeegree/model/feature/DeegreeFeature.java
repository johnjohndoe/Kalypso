 history:
  
 Files in this package are originally taken from deegree and modified here
 to fit in kalypso. As goals of kalypso differ from that one in deegree
 interface-compatibility to deegree is wanted but not retained always. 
     
 If you intend to use this software in other ways than in kalypso 
 (e.g. OGC-web services), you should consider the latest version of deegree,
 see http://www.deegree.org .

/**
 * Features are, according to the Abstract Specification, digital
 * representations of real world entities. Feature Identity thus refers to
 * mechanisms to identify such representations: not to identify the real world
 * entities that are the subject of a representation. Thus two different
 * representations of a real world entity (say the Mississippi River) will be
 * two different features with distinct identities. Real world identification
 * systems, such as title numbers, while possibly forming a sound basis for an
 * implementation of a feature identity mechanism, are not of themselves such a
 * mechanism.
