/**
 * A Mark takes a "shape" and applies coloring to it. The shape can be derived
 * either from a well-known name (such as "square"), an external URL in various
 * formats (such as, perhaps GIF), or from a glyph of a font. Multiple external
 * formats may be used with the semantic that they all contain the equivalent
 * shape in different formats. If an image format is used that has inherent
 * coloring, the coloring is discarded and only the opacity channel (or
 * equivalent) is used. A Halo, Fill, and/or Stroke is applied as appropriate
 * for the shape's source format.
