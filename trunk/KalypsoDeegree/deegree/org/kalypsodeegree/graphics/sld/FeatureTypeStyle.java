 history:
 
 Files in this package are originally taken from deegree and modified here
 to fit in kalypso. As goals of kalypso differ from that one in deegree
 interface-compatibility to deegree is wanted but not retained always. 
 
 If you intend to use this software in other ways than in kalypso 
 (e.g. OGC-web services), you should consider the latest version of deegree,
 see http://www.deegree.org .

 all modifications are licensed as deegree,

 * The FeatureTypeStyle defines the styling that is to be applied to a single feature type of a layer). This element may

 * handling of features of specific feature types. The layer concept is unique to WMS and SLD, but features are used
 * more generally, such as in WFS and GML, so this explicit separation is important.
