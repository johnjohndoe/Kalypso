/**
 * <p>
 * A web feature server has to handle two classes of errors; exceptions that are
 * generated during the processing of a WFS request (such as parsing the
 * request) and exceptions that are generated during the execution of a WFS
 * request (such as a transaction failure). This section deals with exceptions
 * generated during the processing of a WFS request.
 * <p>
 * Exceptions encountered during request execution are dealt with in subsequent
 * sections. In the event that a web feature server encounters an error while
 * processing a request, it shall generate an XML document indicating that an
 * error has occurred.
 * <p>
 * The &lt;WFS_Exception&gt; tag can delimit one or more exception.details.
 * Individual exceptions are delimited using the &lt;Exception&gt; tag.
 * <p>
 * The optional &lt;Locator%gt; element is used to indicate where an exception
 * was encountered. A number of elements defined in this document include a
 * handle attribute that can be used to uniquely identify an element. If such a
 * handle exists, its value would be reported using the <Locator>element. If a
 * handle attribute does not exist or is not defined, then the web feature
 * server can attempt to locate the error using other means such as line
 * numbers, etc...
 * <p>
 * The &lt;Message&gt; element is used to delimit any messages associated with
 * an exception
