/**
 * Provides access to an OpenGIS coverage.
 * The essential property of coverage is to be able to generate a value for any point
 * within its domain. How coverage is represented internally is not a concern.
 *
 * For example consider the following different internal representations of coverage:<br>
 *  <OL>
 *    <li>A coverage may be represented by a set of polygons which exhaustively
 *        tile a plane (that is each point on the plane falls in precisely one polygon).
 *        The value returned by the coverage for a point is the value of an attribute of
 *        the polygon that contains the point.</li>
 *    <li>A coverage may be represented by a grid of values.
 *        The value returned by the coverage for a point is that of the grid value
 *        whose location is nearest the point.</li>
 *    <li>Coverage may be represented by a mathematical function.
 *        The value returned by the coverage for a point is just the return value
 *        of the function when supplied the coordinates of the point as arguments.</li>
 *    <li>Coverage may be represented by combination of these.
 *        For example, coverage may be represented by a combination of mathematical
 *        functions valid over a set of polynomials.</LI>
 * </OL>
 *
 * A coverage has a corresponding {@link CV_SampleDimension} for each sample
 * dimension in the coverage.
