/**
 * A base interface for metadata applicable to coordinate system objects. The metadata items 'Abbreviation', 'Alias',
 * 'Authority', 'AuthorityCode', 'Name' and 'Remarks' were specified in the Simple Features interfaces, so they have
 * been kept here.
 * 
 * This specification does not dictate what the contents of these items should be. However, the following guidelines are
 * suggested:
 * <ul>
 * <li>When {@link CS_CoordinateSystemAuthorityFactory}is used to create an object, the 'Authority' and
 * 'AuthorityCode' values should be set to the authority name of the factory object, and the authority code supplied by
 * the client, respectively. The other values may or may not be set. (If the authority is EPSG, the implementer may
 * consider using the corresponding metadata values in the EPSG tables.)</li>
 * <li>When {@link CS_CoordinateSystemFactory}creates an object, the 'Name' should be set to the value supplied by the
 * client. All of the other metadata items should be left empty.</li>
 * </ul>
