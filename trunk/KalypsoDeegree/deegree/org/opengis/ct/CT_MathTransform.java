     * output points will often be different from the number of input points.

     * A convex hull is a shape in a coordinate system, where if two positions A

     * are both convex hulls.  Other less obvious examples of convex hulls are
     * straight lines, and single points.  (A single point is a convex hull,
     * because the positions A and B must both be the same - i.e. the point
     * itself.  So the straight line between A and B has zero length.)
     *
     * Some examples of shapes that are NOT convex hulls are donuts, and horseshoes.
