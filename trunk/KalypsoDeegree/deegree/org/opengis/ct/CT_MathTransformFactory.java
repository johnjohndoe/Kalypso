/**
 * Creates math transforms. <code>CT_MathTransformFactory</code> is a low level factory that is used to create
 * {@link CT_MathTransform}objects. Many high level GIS applications will never need to use a
 * <code>CT_MathTransformFactory</code> directly; they can use a {@link CT_CoordinateTransformationFactory}instead.
 * However, the <code>CT_MathTransformFactory</code> interface is specified here, since it can be used directly by
 * applications that wish to transform other types of coordinates (e.g. color coordinates, or image pixel coordinates).
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * The following comments assume that the same vendor implements the math transform factory interfaces and math
 * transform interfaces. <br>
 * <br>
 * A math transform is an object that actually does the work of applying formulae to coordinate values. The math
 * transform does not know or care how the coordinates relate to positions in the real world. This lack of semantics
 * makes implementing <code>CT_MathTransformFactory</code> significantly easier than it would be otherwise. <br>
 * <br>
 * For example <code>CT_MathTransformFactory</code> can create affine math transforms. The affine transform applies a
 * matrix to the coordinates without knowing how what it is doing relates to the real world. So if the matrix scales
 * <var>Z </var> values by a factor of 1000, then it could be converting meters into millimeters, or it could be
 * converting kilometers into meters. <br>
 * <br>
 * Because math transforms have low semantic value (but high mathematical value), programmers who do not have much
 * knowledge of how GIS applications use coordinate systems, or how those coordinate systems relate to the real world
 * can implement <code>CT_MathTransformFactory</code>.<br>
 * <br>
 * The low semantic content of math transforms also means that they will be useful in applications that have nothing to
 * do with GIS coordinates. For example, a math transform could be used to map color coordinates between different color
 * spaces, such as converting (red, green, blue) colors into (hue, light, saturation) colors. <br>
 * <br>
 * Since a math transform does not know what its source and target coordinate systems mean, it is not necessary or
 * desirable for a math transform object to keep information on its source and target coordinate systems.
