 history:
 
 Files in this package are originally taken from deegree and modified here
 to fit in kalypso. As goals of kalypso differ from that one in deegree
 interface-compatibility to deegree is wanted but not retained always. 
 
 If you intend to use this software in other ways than in kalypso 
 (e.g. OGC-web services), you should consider the latest version of deegree,
 see http://www.deegree.org .

 all modifications are licensed as deegree,

 * The GraphicStroke element both indicates that a repeated-linear-graphic stroke type will be used.

 * images with no special mark-up, this line will be assumed to be middle pixel row of the image, starting from the
 * first pixel column and ending at the last pixel column.
