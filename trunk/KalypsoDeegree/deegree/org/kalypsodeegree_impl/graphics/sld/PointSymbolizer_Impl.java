 history:
 
 Files in this package are originally taken from deegree and modified here
 to fit in kalypso. As goals of kalypso differ from that one in deegree
 interface-compatibility to deegree is wanted but not retained always. 
 
 If you intend to use this software in other ways than in kalypso 
 (e.g. OGC-web services), you should consider the latest version of deegree,
 see http://www.deegree.org .

/**
 * Used to render a "graphic" at a point. If a line-string or polygon geometry is used with this symbol, then the
 * semantic is to use the centroid of the geometry, or any similar representative point. The meaning of the contained
 * elements are discussed with the element definitions below. If the Geometry element is omitted, then the "default"
 * geometry for the feature type is used. (Many feature types will have only one geometry attribute.) If the Graphic
 * element is omitted, then nothing will be plotted.

   * A Graphic is a "graphic symbol" with an inherent shape, color, and size. Graphics can either be referenced from an
   * external URL in a common format (such as GIF or SVG) or may be derived from a Mark. Multiple external URLs may be
   * referenced with the semantic that they all provide the same graphic in different formats. The "hot spot" to use for
   * rendering at a point or the start and finish handle points to use for rendering a graphic along a line must either
   * be inherent in the external format or are system- dependent. The default size of an image format (such as GIF) is
   * the inherent size of the image. The default size of a format without an inherent size is 16 pixels in height and
   * the corresponding aspect in width. If a size is specified, the height of the graphic will be scaled to that size
   * and the corresponding aspect will be used for the width. The default if neither an ExternalURL nor a Mark is
   * specified is to use the default Mark with a size of 6 pixels. The size is in pixels and the rotation is in degrees
   * clockwise, with 0 (default) meaning no rotation. In the case that a Graphic is derived from a font-glyph Mark, the
   * Size specified here will be used for the final rendering. Allowed CssParameters are "opacity", "size", and
   * "rotation".
