/**
 * This interface provides services for the management of groups of features.
 * These groups can come into being for a number of reasons: e.g. a project as a
 * whole, for the scope of a query, as the result of a query or arbitrarily
 * selected by a user for some common manipulation. A feature's membership of a
 * particular FeatureCollection does not necessarily imply any relationship with
 * other member features. Composite or compound features which own constituent
 * member Features (e.g. an Airport composed of Terminals, Runways, Aprons,
 * Hangars, etc) may also support the FeatureCollection interface to provide a
 * generic means for clients to access constituent members without needing to be
 * aware of the internal implementation details of the compound feature.
