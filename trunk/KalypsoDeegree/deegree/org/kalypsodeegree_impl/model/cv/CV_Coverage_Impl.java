/**
 * Provides access to an OpenGIS coverage. The essential property of coverage is
 * to be able to generate a value for any point within its domain. How coverage
 * is represented internally is not a concern.
 * 
 * For example consider the following different internal representations of
 * coverage: <br>
 * <OL>
 * <li>A coverage may be represented by a set of polygons which exhaustively
 * tile a plane (that is each point on the plane falls in precisely one
 * polygon). The value returned by the coverage for a point is the value of an
 * attribute of the polygon that contains the point.</li>
 * <li>A coverage may be represented by a grid of values. The value returned by
 * the coverage for a point is that of the grid value whose location is nearest
 * the point.</li>
 * <li>Coverage may be represented by a mathematical function. The value
 * returned by the coverage for a point is just the return value of the function
 * when supplied the coordinates of the point as arguments.</li>
 * <li>Coverage may be represented by combination of these. For example,
 * coverage may be represented by a combination of mathematical functions valid
 * over a set of polynomials.</LI>
 * </OL>
 * 
 * A coverage has a corresponding {@link CV_SampleDimension}for each sample
 * dimension in the coverage.
