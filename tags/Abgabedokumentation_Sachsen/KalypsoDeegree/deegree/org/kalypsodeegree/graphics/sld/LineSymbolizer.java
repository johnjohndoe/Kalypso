 history:
  
 Files in this package are originally taken from deegree and modified here
 to fit in kalypso. As goals of kalypso differ from that one in deegree
 interface-compatibility to deegree is wanted but not retained always. 
     
 If you intend to use this software in other ways than in kalypso 
 (e.g. OGC-web services), you should consider the latest version of deegree,
 see http://www.deegree.org .

 all modifications are licensed as deegree,

 * Used to render a "stroke" along a linear geometry. If a point geometry is

 * a polygon is used, then its closed outline is used as the line string (with
 * no end caps). A missing Geometry element selects the default geometry. A
 * missing Stroke element means that nothing will be plotted.
