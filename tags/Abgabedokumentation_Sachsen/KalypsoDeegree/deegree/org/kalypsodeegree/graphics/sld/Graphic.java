 history:
  
 Files in this package are originally taken from deegree and modified here
 to fit in kalypso. As goals of kalypso differ from that one in deegree
 interface-compatibility to deegree is wanted but not retained always. 
     
 If you intend to use this software in other ways than in kalypso 
 (e.g. OGC-web services), you should consider the latest version of deegree,
 see http://www.deegree.org .

/**
 * A Graphic is a "graphic symbol" with an inherent shape, color, and size.
 * Graphics can either be referenced from an external URL in a common format
 * (such as GIF or SVG) or may be derived from a Mark. Multiple external URLs
 * may be referenced with the semantic that they all provide the same graphic in
 * different formats. The "hot spot" to use for rendering at a point or the
 * start and finish handle points to use for rendering a graphic along a line
 * must either be inherent in the external format or are system- dependent. The
 * default size of an image format (such as GIF) is the inherent size of the
 * image. The default size of a format without an inherent size is 16 pixels in
 * height and the corresponding aspect in width. If a size is specified, the
 * height of the graphic will be scaled to that size and the corresponding
 * aspect will be used for the width. The default if neither an ExternalURL nor
 * a Mark is specified is to use the default Mark with a size of 6 pixels. The
 * size is in pixels and the rotation is in degrees clockwise, with 0 (default)
 * meaning no rotation. In the case that a Graphic is derived from a font-glyph
 * Mark, the Size specified here will be used for the final rendering. Allowed
 * CssParameters are "opacity", "size", and "rotation".
