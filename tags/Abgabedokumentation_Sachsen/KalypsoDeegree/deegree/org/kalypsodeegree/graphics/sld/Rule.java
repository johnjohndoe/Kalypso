 history:
  
 Files in this package are originally taken from deegree and modified here
 to fit in kalypso. As goals of kalypso differ from that one in deegree
 interface-compatibility to deegree is wanted but not retained always. 
     
 If you intend to use this software in other ways than in kalypso 
 (e.g. OGC-web services), you should consider the latest version of deegree,
 see http://www.deegree.org .

/**
 * A rule is used to attach a condition to and group the individual symbolizers
 * used for rendering. The Title and Abstract describe the rule and may be used
 * to generate a legend, as may the LegendGraphic. The Filter, ElseFilter,
 * MinScale, and MaxScale elements allow the selection of features and rendering
 * scales for a rule. The scale selection works as follows. When a map is to be
 * rendered, the scale denominator is computed and all rules in all UserStyles
 * that have a scale outside of the request range are dropped. (This also
 * includes Rules that have an ElseFilter.) An ElseFilter is simply an ELSE
 * condition to the conditions (Filters) of all other rules in the same
 * UserStyle. The exact meaning of the ElseFilter is determined after Rules have
 * been eliminated for not fitting the rendering scale. This definition of the
 * behaviour of ElseFilters may seem a little strange, but it allows for scale-
 * dependent and scale-independent ELSE conditions. For the Filter, only
 * SqlExpression is available for specification, but this is a hack and should
 * be replaced with Filter as defined in WFS. A missing Filter element means
 * "always true". If a set of Rules has no ElseFilters, then some features may
 * not be rendered (which is presumably the desired behavior). The Scales are
 * actually scale denominators (as double floats), so "10e6" would be
 * interpreted as 1:10M. A missing MinScale means there is no lower bound to the
 * scale- denominator range (lim[x-&gt;0+](x)), and a missing MaxScale means
 * there is no upper bound (infinity). 0.28mm
