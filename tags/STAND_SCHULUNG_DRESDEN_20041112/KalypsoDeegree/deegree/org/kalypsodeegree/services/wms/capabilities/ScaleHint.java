/**
 * Layers may include a <ScaleHint>element that suggests minimum and maximum
 * scales for which it is appropriate to display this layer. Because WMS output
 * is destined for output devices of arbitrary size and resolution, the usual
 * definition of scale as the ratio of map size to real-world size is not
 * appropriate here. The following definition of Scale Hint is recommended.
 * Consider a hypothetical map with a given Bounding Box, width and height. The
 * central pixel of that map (or the pixel just to the northwest of center) will
 * have some size, which can be expressed as the ground distance in meters of
 * the southwest to northeast diagonal of that pixel. The two values in
 * ScaleHint are the minimum and maximum recommended values of that diagonal. It
 * is recognized that this definition is not geodetically precise, but at the
 * same time the hope is that by including it conventions will develop that can
 * be later specified more clearly.
