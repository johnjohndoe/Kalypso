/**
 * <p>
 * The transform-schema describes the only mandatory request, which is to adapt
 * from the Transformation-Web-Service
 * <p>
 * The basic elememts of the reqest are the coordinate-system of the data
 * (SourceCRS), the coordinate-system in which the data should be transformed
 * (DestinationCRS) and the data itself. Additional to this the format of the
 * incoming data and the results are declared.
 * <p>
 * The determination of a transformation-sequence is optional. Normally several
 * single-transformations are needed for the transformation of coordinates from
 * one system into another. With the &lt;TransformationSequence&gt;- element it
 * is possible to define (a) in which order (b) which transformations should be
 * executed.
 * <p>
 * It is to notice, that the transformationservice is based on the OpenGIS
 * implemantation specification &quot;Coordinate Transformation Service
 * 1.0.0&quot;. I. e. that the transformation of a geometry results from the
 * transformation of its particular coordinates. Splines and other not-linear
 * interpolations get not explicit transformed. So, for the the incoming data
 * only point-geometries and linear interpolated geometries are acceptable. In
 * addition to the GML-coded geometries a coding of &quot;Well Known Text&quot;
 * (WKT) is possible. A WKT-geometry is transported as a string.
