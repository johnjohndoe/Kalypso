/**
 * Web connections are inherently stateless. Unfortunately, this means that the
 * semantics of serializable transactions are not preserved. To understand the
 * issue consider an UPDATE operation.
 * <p>
 * The client fetches a feature instance. The feature is then modified on the
 * client side, and submitted back to the database, via a Transaction request
 * for update. Serializability is lost since there is nothing to guarantee that
 * while the feature was being modified on the client side, another client did
 * not come along and update that same feature in the database.
 * <p>
 * One way to ensure serializability is to require that access to data be done
 * in a mutually exclusive manner; that is while one transaction accesses a data
 * item, no other transaction can modify the same data item. This can be
 * accomplished by using locks that control access to the data.
 * <p>
 * The purpose of the LockFeature interface is to expose a long term feature
 * locking mechanism to ensure consistency. The lock is considered long term
 * because network latency would make feature locks last relatively longer than
 * native commercial database locks.
 * <p>
 * The LockFeature interface is optional and need only be implemented if the
 * underlying datastore supports (or can be made to support) data locking. In
 * addition, the implementation of locking is completely opaque to the client.
