 history:
  
 Files in this package are originally taken from deegree and modified here
 to fit in kalypso. As goals of kalypso differ from that one in deegree
 interface-compatibility to deegree is wanted but not retained always. 
     
 If you intend to use this software in other ways than in kalypso 
 (e.g. OGC-web services), you should consider the latest version of deegree,
 see http://www.deegree.org .

/**
 * In addition to using named layers, it is also useful to be able to define
 * custom user-defined layers for rendering.
 * <p>
 * </p>
 * Since a layer is defined as a collection of potentially mixed-type features,
 * the UserLayer element must provide the means to identify the features to be
 * used. All features to be rendered are assumed to be fetched from a Web
 * Feature Server (WFS) or a Web Coverage Service (WCS, in which case the term
 * features is used loosely).
