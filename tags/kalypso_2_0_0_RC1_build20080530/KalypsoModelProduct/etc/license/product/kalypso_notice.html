<h3>Usage Of Content</h3>

<p>USE OF THIS CONTENT IS GOVERNED BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS 
AGREEMENT AND/OR THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES 
INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW. BY USING THE CONTENT, YOU AGREE THAT YOUR 
USE OF THE CONTENT IS GOVERNED BY THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE TERMS AND 
CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR 
REFERENCED BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS 
AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS 
OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE THE CONTENT.</p>

<h3>Applicable Licenses</h3>

<p>Unless otherwise indicated, all Content is provided to you under the 
terms and conditions of the GNU Lesser General Public License (&quot;LGPL&quot;).
A copy of the LGPL is provided with this Content and is also available at 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html</a>.
</p>

<p>Content includes, but is not limited to, source code, object
code, documentation and other files maintained in the Kalypso CVS
repository (&quot;Repository&quot;) in CVS modules (&quot;Modules&quot;)
and made available as downloadable archives (&quot;Downloads&quot;).</p>

<ul>
	<li>Content may be structured and packaged into modules to
	facilitate delivering, extending, and upgrading the Content. Typical
	modules may include plug-ins (&quot;Plug-ins&quot;), plug-in fragments
	(&quot;Fragments&quot;), and features (&quot;Features&quot;).</li>
	<li>Each Plug-in or Fragment may be packaged as a sub-directory or
	JAR (Java&trade; ARchive) in a directory named &quot;plugins&quot;.</li>
	<li>A Feature is a bundle of one or more Plug-ins and/or Fragments
	and associated material. Each Feature may be packaged as a
	sub-directory in a directory named &quot;features&quot;. Within a
	Feature, files named &quot;feature.xml&quot; may contain a list of the
	names and version numbers of the Plug-ins and/or Fragments associated
	with that Feature.</li>
	<li>Features may also include other Features (&quot;Included
	Features&quot;). Within a Feature, files named &quot;feature.xml&quot;
	may contain a list of the names and version numbers of Included
	Features.</li>
</ul>

<p>The terms and conditions governing Plug-ins and Fragments should
be contained in files named &quot;about.html&quot; (&quot;Abouts&quot;).
The terms and conditions governing Features and Included Features should
be contained in files named &quot;license.html&quot; (&quot;Feature
Licenses&quot;). Abouts and Feature Licenses may be located in any
directory of a Download or Module including, but not limited to the
following locations:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The top-level (root) directory</li>
	<li>Plug-in and Fragment directories</li>
	<li>Inside Plug-ins and Fragments packaged as JARs</li>
	<li>Sub-directories of the directory named &quot;src&quot; of
	certain Plug-ins</li>
	<li>Feature directories</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: if a Feature made available by any plug-in provider is
installed using the Eclipse Update Manager, you must agree to a license
(&quot;Feature Update License&quot;) during the installation process. If
the Feature contains Included Features, the Feature Update License
should either provide you with the terms and conditions governing the
Included Features or inform you where you can locate them. Feature
Update Licenses may be found in the &quot;license&quot; property of
files named &quot;feature.properties&quot; found within a Feature. Such
Abouts, Feature Licenses, and Feature Update Licenses contain the terms
and conditions (or references to such terms and conditions) that govern
your use of the associated Content in that directory.</p>

<p>THE ABOUTS, FEATURE LICENSES, AND FEATURE UPDATE LICENSES MAY
REFER TO THE LGPL OR OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS, NOTICES OR TERMS AND
CONDITIONS. SOME OF THESE OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS ARE LISTED IN THE 
ATTACHED FILE <a href="./libraries.html">LIBRARIES.HTML</a>. IT IS YOUR OBLIGATION TO READ AND ACCEPT 
ALL SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS PRIOR TO USE OF THE CONTENT.</p>
