/**
 * A local coordinate system, with uncertain relationship to the world.
 * In general, a local coordinate system cannot be related to other
 * coordinate systems. However, if two objects supporting this interface
 * have the same dimension, axes, units and datum then client code
 * is permitted to assume that the two coordinate systems are identical.
 * This allows several datasets from a common source (e.g. a CAD system)
 * to be overlaid.
 * In addition, some implementations of the Coordinate Transformation (CT)
 * package may have a mechanism for correlating local datums.
 * (E.g. from a database of transformations, which is created and
 * maintained from real-world measurements.)
