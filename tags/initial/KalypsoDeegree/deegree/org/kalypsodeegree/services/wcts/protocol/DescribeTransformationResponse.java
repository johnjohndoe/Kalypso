 /**
 * <p> As an answer to a DescribeTransformationRequest the service answers with one 
 * list including all single transformations which can be accomplished, in 
 * order to convert a coordinate from a sourcecoordinatensystem into a 
 * target system. As the attribute the number of necessary transformations is 
 * returned. If the transformation described is not 
 * possible, no transformation is returned and the numberOfTransformations is ' 0 '.
 * Reasons for the missing possibility to perform a transformation can be that 
 * the service does not know/implement the necessary transformation steps, or that a 
 * transformation not is not possible in principle (e.g. 3d to 2d systems). An 
 * exception is returned only if an error aroses during processing the request .
