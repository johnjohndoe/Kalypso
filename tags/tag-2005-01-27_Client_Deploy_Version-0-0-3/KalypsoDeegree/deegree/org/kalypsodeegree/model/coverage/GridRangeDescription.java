 history:
  
 Files in this package are originally taken from deegree and modified here
 to fit in kalypso. As goals of kalypso differ from that one in deegree
 interface-compatibility to deegree is wanted but not retained always. 
     
 If you intend to use this software in other ways than in kalypso 
 (e.g. OGC-web services), you should consider the latest version of deegree,
 see http://www.deegree.org .
