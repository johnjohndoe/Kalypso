 * A set of quantities from which other quantities are calculated. For the OGC abstract model, it can be defined as a

 * completely the origin and orientation of a coordinate system with respect to the earth. <br>
 * <br>
 * A textual description and/or a set of parameters describing the relationship of a coordinate system to some
 * predefined physical locations (such as center of mass) and physical directions (such as axis of spin). The definition
 * of the datum may also include the temporal behavior (such as the rate of change of the orientation of the coordinate
 * axes).
