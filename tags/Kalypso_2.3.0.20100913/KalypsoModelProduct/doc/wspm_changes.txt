Changelog of Kalypso-WSPM
=========================

since 26.06.2007
----------------
XXXXX

since 07.05.2007
----------------
- Some of the unused stuff in calculation dialogs hidden (depends on choosen calculation mode)
- New calculation mode: 'konstantes Reibungsgefälle'
- Supports creation of Polynomials after BF_UNIFORM and REIB_KONST calculations; also supports various parameters for polynomial creation  



since 23.03.2007
----------------
- Bugfix: Stations are no longer incorrectly rounded to 4 significant digits while importing from wspwin. Instead, they are now rounded to 4 fraction digits.
- Bugfix [#95]: After deletion of one profile (without deselecting it from its referencing strands), the calculation now ignores these strands and still runs.
- Bugfix [#94]: Stations now gets alwas rounded to 4 fraction digits instead of 4 significant digits.  

since 15.02.2007
---------------
- Bugfix [#84] Strange linear water-boundary: No sorting is any more needed for reach-segments. Sorting is done automatically before calculation.
- Subelements of reaches are not displayed any more in tree-view.
- Bugfix [#85] Dangling references in reaches: The reach view does not crash any more if the segments contain empty references to profiles.
- Fixed comment bug (name, comment disapeared after change to profile in profileditor, strange commment after import from wspwin)
- Sorting is now possible for all lists of features (instead of only profiles); TODO: reverse sort; sort by name; ...
- [#83] filenames for prf.-export: Most of the strange characters are now replaced by '_', so importing should work better.
- non-uniform bankfull calculation: Results are now retrieved as functions (singular points) over h and may be displayed as diagramms. Furthermore, polynomials (as input for the instationary calculation) are calulated automatically from the points and displayed as well.
- Feature request [#92]: Rougness-Intersection now supports multi-surface polygones.

since 30.01.2007
----------------
- Bugfix: Deletion of Buildings in Profile-Editor now works
- Length-Section: additional layers, outline-view toggles visibility and show legend-icons
- Length-Section: save of changed .kod file enabled
- Sorting of profiles now possible. Popup dialog lets the user choose from property to sort by.
